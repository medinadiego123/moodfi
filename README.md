# Moodfi ðŸŽ¶

Moodfi is an AI-powered playlist generator that creates personalized Spotify playlists based on your mood, genre, and artist preferences. It leverages multiple AI APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, DeepSeek) for mood analysis and uses your listening history to refine recommendations.

## Features

- **Personalized Playlists:**  
  Generate playlists based on your mood and listening history.
  
- **AI Mood Analysis:**  
  Uses OpenAI as the primary engine for mood analysis, with Gemini and DeepSeek as fallbacks.

- **Fallback Logic:**  
  For new users, Moodfi provides generalized mood-based tracks. For existing users, it leverages your top artists and tracks to tailor recommendations.

- **Spotify Integration:**  
  Authenticates via Spotify OAuth, creates public playlists, and adds tracks to them.

- **Responsive UI:**  
  A modern, ChatGPT-like interface built with EJS and custom CSS.
